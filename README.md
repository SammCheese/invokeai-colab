# invokeai-colab
Notebook for running Invoke AI GUI in a free Google Colab GPU runtime.

This notebook requires generating huggingface and NGROK tokens and entering them in the code where specified.

Persistent GDrive storage can be configured. Preparing the environment uses quite a lot of disk space.

I have no clue what I am doing but this works as of commit. It is available at the printed NGROK URL after clicking "Run All".

Sometimes a crash occurs due to memory usage while switching models.
